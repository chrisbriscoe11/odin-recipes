        <li>1 to 1 ½ pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs cut into 1” pieces</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon ground ginger or 1 to 2 teaspoons minced ginger or ginger paste</li>
        <li>2 to 3 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>sesame seeds optional garnish</li>
        <li>green onion optional garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup chicken broth low sodium</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons soy sauce low sodium</li>
        <li>½ cup honey</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sriracha or 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, optional</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Prepare the Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the sauce by whisking together the corn starch with a couple tablespoons of chicken broth until smooth.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the remaining chicken broth, soy sauce, honey, toasted sesame oil and sriracha or crushed red pepper flakes, if using. Set aside.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make The Chicken</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add oil to a large skillet or wok and heat over medium high heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Combine the corn starch, garlic powder and ground ginger in a small, shallow bowl and whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Toss the pieces of chicken in the mixture, a few pieces at a time, until coated.</li>
        <li>Add chicken (in batches if necessary) to the hot oil and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, turning the chicken pieces over so they brown evenly. (Check to make sure chicken is cooked through.) Remove and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add minced garlic to the skillet and cook garlic, stirring continuously for 1 minute</li>
        <li>Carefully pour in the prepared sauce and stir to combine with the garlic. Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add chicken back to skillet and stir to combine. Continue cooking until preferred thickness and consistency is achieved, about 2 to 5 minutes. Test for seasoning and add salt and pepper if needed.</li>
        <li>Garnish with sesame seeds and sliced green onion and serve over rice or with your preferred side.</li>
    </ol>
